# Example Storybook Design Project

Hi all, welcome ðŸ˜€

## Summary

This project was built with

- Storybook 6.0+,
- NextJS 10+,
- Tailwind CSS 2.0+,
- Styled Components
- Twin.Macro

## Design Principles

Design principles shape how we design components, and the related features we use in our apps and
websites.

The principles and guidelines are documented in Storybook. In effect this is a UI component library,
which follows some of the most common design principles and features. It helps keep design and
development in sync.

We can design components in Storybook and translate this back to code. It also helps keep the design
lifecycle going, and acts as a single source of reference.

## Design Tokens

Whilst the components provide the building blocks of our apps, design tokens define a set of
priorities we can use to shape our components appearance.

Common Tokens:

- Typography
- Colours
  - Background
  - Text
  - Border -Spacings
- Iconography

Tokens make it easy to ensure that your design is consistent, and even easier to update it as your
design evolves.

They can be used to maintain consistent and scalable visual UI development, to replace hard code
values (hex code, spacing etc.).

`Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system - specifically they are the named entities that store visual design attributes`

## Atomic Design Principles

Atomic Design is now over 6 years old and was introduced by Brad Frost.

We will follow the Atomic Design principle within this library.

Hence, the folder structure is as follows

```
Components
|__Atoms
|__Molecules
|__Organisms
|__Particles
|__Pages
|__Templates

```
