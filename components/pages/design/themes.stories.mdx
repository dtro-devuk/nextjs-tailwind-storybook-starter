# Themeable Design Systems

Themeability, is a design feature that allows you to chnage the look and feel of the UI, throughout the Design process.

Themeability is often overlooked when creating a designing a design system.
However, its important to give it more respect earlier in the design process, as its often more difficult to retro-fit theme's at a later date.
For themeability to work successfully it needs forethought and architecture within the design library, as well as the coded library.

It entails the following:

- Dark mode
- Product specific look and feel
- Whitelabeling (i.e. the ability to be re-branded, multiple times if neccessary, e.g. LinkedIn and Facebook)
- Marketing and Branding
- Accessibility
- Makes a design robust and resilient

Themeing is about how we colourize things (background, border colour, text colour).
Its not about size, layout, hierarchy or content.

We use theme variables like design tokens to build the design.

Themeing tends to define the following:

- background colour
- text colour
- primary colour
- secondary colour
- heading colour
- link colour
- border colour

# Using Tailwind Themes

This project uses Tailwindcss so a lot of colour props are passed in as CSS classes that Tailwind
applies styling to i.e. `text-blue-500` to use the primary blue.

We use Tailwinds Theme Configuration for our project design themability.

Tailwind CSS is a highly customizeable CSS framework, that gives us all the builiding blocks to build custom interfaces and components.
However, its a low-level framework so it only provides the low level utilities to create themes.
